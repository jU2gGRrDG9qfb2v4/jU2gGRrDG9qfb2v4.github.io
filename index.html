	  		<img src="img/headshot.jpg" style="margin: auto" />

	  		<p>During Q3 2018 Jason Sivich collected 10+ BTC from a group of investors for a cryptocurrency fund. On March 31, 2019, he announced he was closing the fund and paying back investors. He has failed to pay back any money (totaling over $65,000 at the time of this writing) and has stopped communication with investors. We believe there may be more victims, please contact us at jasonsivichcase@protonmail.com with any additional information.</p>
